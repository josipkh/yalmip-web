[cone](/command/cone) is used to define the constraint \\(\left \lvert x \right\rvert_2 \leq y\\) without invoking the overhead of using the [norm](/command/norm) operator.


## Syntax

````matlab
c = cone(x,y)
````

## Examples

Constraining the Euclidean norm of a vector to be less than 1 is done with

````matlab
x = sdpvar(n,1);
F = cone(x,1);
````

An alternative form is

````matlab
F = cone([1;x]);
````

Of course, arbitrary complicated constructs are possible, such as constraining the norm of the diagonal to be less than the sum of the off-diagonal terms in a matrix.

````matlab
x = sdpvar(n,n);
F = cone(diag(x),sum(sum(x-diag(diag(x)))))
````

An alternative is to use the norm operator instead (see the examples on nonlinear operators for details)

````matlab
x = sdpvar(n,n);
F = norm(diag(x)) <= sum(sum(x-diag(diag(x))))
````

The benefit of using the [cone](/command/cone) command is that the overhead in YALMIP is reduced (no convexity analysis is required).

The operator can be used in a vectorized form. The following model

````matlab
x = sdpvar(n,1);
y = sdpvar(n,1);
F = [cone(x,1), cone(y,2)]
````

is equivalent to

````matlab
x = sdpvar(n,1);
y = sdpvar(n,1);
F = [cone([1 2;
           x y])]
````
