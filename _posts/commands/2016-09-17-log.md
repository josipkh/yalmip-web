[log](/command/log) overloads the natural logarithm. In addition to the natural logarithm, YALMIP also overloads [log2](/command/log) and [log10](/command/log).

Since logarithms easily causes numerical issues in nonlinear solvers, so to avoid some problems YALMIP also has a  special construction \\( \log(1+x)\\) (shifted log) which automatically is extracted from models. For the same reason, YALMIP automatically detects so called [perspective logarithms](/command/plog) \\(x\log(y/x)\\).

## Syntax

````matlab
y = log(x)
y = log2(x)
y = log10(x)
y = slog(x) % Shifted log, typically not used manually
y = log(1+x)
y = log(1+x)
````

## Comments

Logarithmic functions are implemented as convexity aware [callback operators](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorscallback), except when [Mosek 9](/solver/mosek), [SCS](/solver/scs) or [ECOS](/solver/ecos) are used and the exponential cone description is exploited in a [graph representation](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorsgraphs).
