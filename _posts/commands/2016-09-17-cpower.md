[cpower](/command/cpower) is used to create a conic model of rational powers.

## Syntax

````matlab
y = cpower(x,p);
````

## Example

Plot a TV-screen!

````matlab
x = sdpvar(2,1);
plot(sum(cpower(x,4)) <= 1);
````

## Comment

The operator is implemented using a [graph representation](/tutorial/nonlinearoperatorsgraphs) based on a second-order cone models, and can thus only be used in scenarios where YALMIP can propagate convexity in a conic form.

In nonconvex scenarios, or when you do not want to generate a conic mode, simply use standard power, **x.^p**.
