[expcone](/command/expcone) is used to define the exponential cone constraint \\(  (ye^{x/y}\leq z, y>0) \\).

## Syntax

````matlab
Model = expcone([x,y,z])
Model = expcone([x;y;z]) % Stacked form
Model = expcone([X;Y;Z]) % Stacked vectorized form (each column defines an exponential cone
````
In most situations you would not use this low-level operator but rely on the built-in modelling layer for [exponential cone programming](/tutorial/exponentialcone/).
