Release with new and improved solver support, and some minor fixes.

### Main fixes and additions

* Added support for [COPT](/solver/copt), thanks to the LEAVES group, RIIS at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics
* Updated support for [KNITRO 13.2](/solver/knitro)
* Updated support for [XPRESS 9.0](/solver/xpress)
* [KKT](/command/kkt/#nonlinear) now supports nonlinearly parameterized models
* Massive performance improvement on large sparse polynomial objectives in nonlinear solvers due to faster gradient computation
* Fixed bug which caused gradient information to be incorrect when [EXPCONE](/command/expcone) models are solved with general nonlinear solvers
* The options bnb.plot and bmibnb.plot now mean the same thing (graphical view of lower/upper bound and stack information)
* Some minor issues which caused issues when upgrading from 2021-verion
