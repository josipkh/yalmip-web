Material from the mini-course on *YALMIP and MPT for Optimization and Modelling in Control* at the Swedish control meeting is now available [minicourse_updated.zip](/pub/minicourse_updated.zip).

Note: The code is slightly outdated as it uses the command solvesdp instead of [optimize](/command/optimize), and double instead of [value](/command/value).
