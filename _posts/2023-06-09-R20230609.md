Release with possibly breaking core changes, new features, and 2 years of bug fixes.

### Main fixes and additions

* Strict inequalities now trigger errors (no more kittens).
* Square symmetric inequalities now trigger warnings (detects extremely common user mistake).
* A bunch of old obsolete solvers removed and are no longer supported.
* [@araujoms](https://github.com/araujoms) [improved support for complex cones via sedumi](https://mateusaraujo.info/2023/03/14/sdps-with-complex-numbers/) in [automatic dualization](/tutorial/automaticdualization).
* [BMIBNB](/solver/bmibnb/) improvements both algoritmically and performance.
* [BNB](/solver/bnb/) cleaned up bug fixes (memory hogging) and improved performance for some models (more on that later in separate post).
* [GUROBI](/solver/gurobi/) options structure now up to date.
* [DAQP](/solver/daqp) added as supported solver.
* [yalmiptest](/command/yalmiptest/) cleaned up and improved.
* Added some geometric operators such as [vertex](/command/vertex/), [isoutside](/command/isoutside/), [starpolygon](/example/starshaped/).
* Experimental (pre-alpha) support of nonlinear semidefinite programming (more on that later in separate post).
* Option 'usex0' should be updated to 'warmstart' (both supported for now)
* Code fixed to support Octave 8.
