This tutorial requires [MPT](/solver/mpt).

YALMIP can be used to calculate explicit solutions of parametric linear and quadratic programs by interfacing the [Multi-Parametric Toolbox MPT](/solver/mpt). This tutorial assumes that the reader is familiar with parametric programming and the basics of [MPT](/solver/mpt).

### Generic example.

Consider the following simple quadratic program in the decision variable **z**, solved for a particular value on a *parameter* **x**.

````matlab
A = randn(15,3);
b = rand(15,1);
E = randn(15,2);

z = sdpvar(3,1);
x = [0.1;0.2];

F = [A*z <= b+E*x];
obj = (z-1)'*(z-1);

sol = optimize(F,obj);
value(z)
ans =
   -0.1454
   -0.1789
   -0.0388
````

To obtain the parametric solution with respect to **x**, we call the function [solvemp](/command/solvemp), and tell the solver that **x** is a parametric variable. Moreover, we must add constraints on **x** to define the region where we want to compute the parametric solution, the so called exploration set.

````matlab
x = sdpvar(2,1);
F = [A*z <= b+E*x, -1 <= x <= 1];
sol = solvemp(F,obj,[],x);
````

The first output is an [MPT](/solver/mpt) structure. In accordance with [MPT](/solver/mpt) syntax, the optimizer for the parametric value (0.1,0.2) is given by the following code.

````matlab
xx = [0.1;0.2];
[i,j] = isinside(sol{1}.Pn,xx)
sol{1}.Fi{j}*xx + sol{1}.Gi{j}
ans =
   -0.1454
   -0.1789
   -0.0388
````  

By using more outputs from [solvemp](/command/solvemp), it is possible to simplify things considerably.

````matlab
[sol,diagnostics,aux,Valuefunction,OptimalSolution] = solvemp(F,obj,[],x);
````

The function now returns solutions using YALMIPs [nonlinear operator framework](/tutorial/nonlinearoperators). To retrieve the numerical solution for a particular parameter value, simply use [assign](/command/assign) and [value](/command/value) in standard fashion.

````matlab
assign(x,[0.1;0.2]);
value(OptimalSolution)
````

Some of the plotting capabilities of [MPT](/solver/mpt) are overloaded for the piecewise functions. Hence, we can plot the piecewise quadratic value function

````matlab
plot(Valuefunction);
````
![Value function]({{ site.url }}/images/valuefunction1.png){: .center-image }

and plot the piecewise affine optimizer

````matlab
figure
plot(OptimalSolution(1));
````

### Simple MPC example

Define numerical data for a linear system, prediction matrices, and variables for current state \\(x\\) and the future control sequence \\( U(x)\\), for an MPC problem with horizon 5 (**create_CHS** is a cheat function that creates the numerical matrices to describe the linear relation between current state \\( x\\) and future input sequence \\( U\\), to the predicted outputs. See the [standard MPC example](/example/standardmpc) to see how you would do this in a more generic fashion in an actual application)

````matlab
N = 5;
A = [2 -1;1 0];
B = [1;0];
C = [0.5 0.5];
[H,S] = create_CHS(A,B,C,N);
x = sdpvar(2,1);
U = sdpvar(N,1);
````  

The future output predictions are linear in the current state and the control sequence.

````matlab
Y = H*x+S*U;
````  

We wish to minimize a quadratic cost, compromising between small input and outputs.

````matlab
objective = Y'*Y+U'*U;
````  

The input variable has a hard constraint, and so does the output at the terminal state.

````matlab
F = [1 >= U >= -1, 1 >= Y(N) >= -1];
````  

We seek the explicit solution \\( U(x)\\) over the exploration set \\( \left \lvert x\right \rvert \leq 5\\)

````matlab
F = [F, 5 >= x >= -5];
````

The explicit solution \\( U(x)\\) is obtained by calling [solvemp](/command/solvemp) with the parametric variable \\( x \\) as the fourth argument. Additionally, since we only are interested in the first element of the solution \\( U(x)\\), we use a fifth input to communicate this.

````matlab
[sol,diagnostics,aux,Valuefunction,OptimalSolution] = solvemp(F,objective,[],x,U(1));
````

We can plot the overloaded solutions directly

````matlab
figure
plot(Valuefunction)
figure
plot(OptimalSolution)
````


### Mixed integer multiparametric programming

YALMIP extends the multiparametric solvers in [MPT](/solver/mpt) by adding support for binary variables in the parametric problems.

Let us solve an extension of the MPC problem from the previous section. To begin with, we formulate a similar problem (shorter horizon and linear cost)

````matlab
N = 3;
A = [2 -1;1 0];
B = [1;0];
C = [0.5 0.5];
[H,S] = create_CHS(A,B,C,N);
x = sdpvar(2,1);
U = sdpvar(N,1);
Y = H*x+S*U;

objective = norm(Y,1) + norm(U,1);

F = [1 >= U >= -1];
F = [F, 5 >= x >= -5];
````

We will now solve this problem under the additional constraints that the input is quantized in steps of 1/3. This can easily be modelled in YALMIP using [ismember](/command/ismember). Note that this nonconvex operator introduces a lot of binary variables, and the MPC problem is most likely solved more efficiently using a [dynamic programming approach](/example/explicitmpc).

````matlab
F = [F, ismember(U,[-1:1/3:1])];
````

Same commands as before to solve the problem and plot the optimal solution

````matlab
[sol,diagnostics,aux,Valuefunction,OptimalSolution] = solvemp(F,objective,[],x,U(1));
plot(OptimalSolution);
````
