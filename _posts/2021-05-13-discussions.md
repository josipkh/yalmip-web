As an alternative to the Google groups forum which I know some people have problems with, there is the [YALMIPs GitHub discussion board](https://github.com/yalmip/YALMIP/discussions).

In addition to having a slightly more modern feel, a nice benefit is that questions automatically can be converted into issues if necessary, and vice versa.
